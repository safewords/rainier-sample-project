// The canonical Vite config for a Rainier application.
//
// Three things matter to the framework's `@vite` directive, and this file is
// all three:
//
//   1. The entries: what a template may name in `@vite([...])`.
//   2. The manifest: `public/build/manifest.json`, which resolves an entry to
//      its content-hashed output after `npm run build`.
//   3. The hot file: `public/hot`, holding the dev server's origin while
//      `npm run dev` runs — its presence is what flips the directive into
//      dev-server mode, and its removal flips it back.
//
// The `rainier()` plugin below is the whole backend integration — ~20 lines,
// no extra npm dependency to version.
